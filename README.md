# ❄️ Project X  
### Prototype 0.1 — A Sovereign Micro‑OS

Project X is a lightweight, modular micro‑operating system built on Alpine Linux and designed to be stable, minimal, and ceremonial in its structure.  
This prototype represents the **first public milestone** in the Project X lineage — a clean, crash‑free foundation for future evolution.

## 🧊 What Is Project X?

Project X is a sovereign OS environment created to be:

- **Minimal** — no bloat, no unnecessary layers  
- **Stable** — tested extensively with zero crashes  
- **Modular** — TUI and GUI layers kept clean and separate  
- **Mythic** — every version is a ceremonial step in the OS’s evolution  
- **Portable** — runs inside Termux using an Alpine rootfs  

This prototype is the beginning of a long‑term vision:  
a fully sovereign OS with its own GUI, identity, and ecosystem.
